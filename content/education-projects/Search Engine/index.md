Developed a full-featured search engine from scratch, including text preprocessing (normalization, tokenization, stemming, stopword removal), positional inverted indexing, and query processing (normal, phrase using permuterm index, and Boolean queries). Implemented Zipf’s and Heaps’ laws, tf-idf weighting, cosine similarity ranking, and index elimination via champion lists to efficiently retrieve and rank relevant documents.
